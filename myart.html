    <p>Art has always been a big part of my life. <br>
        I've been into drawing and painting and creating for<br>
         a very long time, and i continue to make art today.<br>
          It's one of my favorite things to do in my free time, <br>
          though since i am such a perfectionist there are only a few <br>
          pieces of mine that i really like. Here are some;</p>
